    ## Derived probabilites:
    P(Pos and MS): P(Pos/MS) * P(MS)
    P(Pos and MF): P(Pos/MF) * P(MF)
    P(Neg and MS): P(Neg/MS) * P(MS)
    P(Neg and MF): P(Neg/MF) * P(MF)
    P(Neg): P(Neg and MS) + P(Neg and MF)
    P(Pos): P(Pos and MS) + P(Pos and MF)
    P(MS|Pos): P(Pos and MS) / P(Pos)
    P(MS|Neg): P(Neg and MS) / P(Neg)
    P(MF|Pos): P(Pos and MF) / P(Pos)
    P(MF|Neg): P(Neg and MF) / P(Neg)
